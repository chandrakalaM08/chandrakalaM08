### Hi there üëã

# üí´ About Me:
Hello! I'm Chandrakala Masiwal, a passionate and driven professional transitioning from a successful career in technical recruitment to pursuing my dream of becoming a software developer. With a strong foundation in JavaScript, ReactJs, HTML, and CSS, I am focused on honing my skills and expertise in full-stack web development.

My journey into the world of technology began during my tenure as a technical IT recruiter, where I had the opportunity to closely work with talented professionals in the field. This experience ignited a curiosity and passion within me to delve deeper into the technical aspects of software development. I am now dedicated to leveraging my recruitment expertise and combining it with my newfound technical skills to contribute to the creation of impactful and scalable products.

I am a detail-oriented and analytical individual who thrives in challenging and dynamic environments. Throughout my career, I have cultivated strong teamwork and adaptability skills, allowing me to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams and adapt to evolving project requirements. My strong work ethic and commitment to continuous learning enable me to stay updated with the latest technologies and industry trends.

When I'm not immersed in coding, you can find me cherishing moments with my beloved cats.

I am excited to connect with fellow professionals, collaborate on innovative projects, and contribute to the ever-evolving world of software development. 

If you're looking for a dedicated and passionate full-stack web developer, I would love to connect and explore potential opportunities together.
